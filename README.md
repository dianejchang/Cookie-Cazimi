# Overview
This repository contains an analysis of past sales data from my home bakery, Cookie Cazimi, aimed at identifying the flavor preferences of my local community. The goal is to determine which product base flavors and add-in categories best align with customer tastes and prioritize them for the upcoming year.
Each week, I offer a rotating selection of cookie flavors at the local farmers market, which operates from April to the end of November. This data will guide my 2025 weekly offerings to increase revenue and help establish a standard menu by 2026.
# Data Sources
Data was collected via two Point of Sales systems, Square and HotPlate, between May to December 2024.
# Tools & Technologies
GitHub Pages (for portfolio hosting and SQL documentation)
Google Sheets (for data cleaning and pivot tables)
Lucidchart (for schema mapping)
Tableau (for visualizations)
# Project Structure
1. Schema Mapping: Mapped dataset schema using Lucidchart.
2. Database Creation for SQL: Created CSV files in Google Sheets and uploaded them for use in PostgreSQL.
3. SQL Queries: Queried and analyzed data in PostgreSQL.
4. Tableau Visualizations: Visualized insights for easy interpretation and analysis.
5. Database Creation for Pivot Tables: Structured data for pivot table analysis.
6. Data Cleaning: Cleaned and organized the "Product Sold" and "Product Ingredients" datasets.
7. Pivot Table Analysis: Analyzed Most Popular Product Base Flavors (PBF), Most Popular PBF by Venue, and Best-Selling Add-In Categories for the Top 3 PBFs

# Key Insights
The top three Product Base Flavors (PBF) in 2024 were Signature, Lemon, and Chocolate.
Lemon had the least add-in category variation but still ranked in the top two.
Chocolate offered the most add-in variations, especially with fillings, flavorings, and miscellaneous options.
## 2025 Strategy
- Ensure each weekly menu includes cookies with filling, fruit, nuts, or a combination (e.g., fruit and filling).
- Track sales performance of these add-ins versus those without to identify best-sellers.
- After gathering enough data, introduce new add-ins like butterscotch chips, dehydrated marshmallows, and toffee bits to test future potential.
# Updates
This repository will be updated with 2025 sales data, allowing for a comparison of how the new flavor offerings perform based on the 2024 insights.
